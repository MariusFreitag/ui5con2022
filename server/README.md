# Demo Server

The server used for the demo is a copy of https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2021-IIS160 (**IIS160 - Accelerate the Development of SAP Fiori Apps Using SAP Fiori Elements**). After copying it, not relevant files have been removed and annotations have been added to make the object page that is created as part of the demo more visually appealing.
